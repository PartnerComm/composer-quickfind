## Notes
This was originally copied over from the Roche project. There were issues with the site redirecting to a /site-preferences page which didn't exist for the MSK project it was copied into. So... it's currently a mix between Roche and MSK. At some point need a way to pull out the vendor specific differences, or make those differences configurable
